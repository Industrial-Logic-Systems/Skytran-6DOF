HOW TO USE

CONVERT THE PROFILES:
First you must convert the motion profiles using the "convert.py" script found in the scripts directory
To do this just double click the file and if it asks for a program find and select python.
It will prompt you with an open dialog.
Use this to select the profile you want to convert
If there are any problems with converting the script will ask you if you want to shift the profile
Press 'Y' to shift the motion profile and chose the Z-axis by entering 'z'
Now set the offset in mm, I recommend starting at 10 and keep increasing by 10 until the conversion succeeds
When it has completed the conversion it will prompt you to save the new profile.

RUN THE PROFILES:
Double click "Skytan_6DOF.exe"
Chose the profile to run.
After a couple of seconds the platform will do the sequence of moves
and will close when completed.
